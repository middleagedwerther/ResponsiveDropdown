All quotes received were similar in price but one contractor stomped all over our plants during the inspection and another made us feel that he was doing us a favour just quoting.Luke Eastick however, was friendly and considerate so we decided to go with Eastside Fencing and we are now very pleased with our choice. Luke and his team were friendly and efficient, they protected our plants, any problems encountered were quickly resolved and the completed fence is of a high standard.We have no hesitation in recommending Eastside Fencing to anybody looking for a fencing contractor.</h3>
